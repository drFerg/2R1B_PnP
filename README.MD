Two Rooms and A Boom
====================


 A custom PnP version of the popular social deduction party game, Two Rooms and A Boom. The existing print and play version is pretty damn ugly and the cards lack any useful character info, so this version aims to resolve that.

![Example Cards](/img/example_cards.png)

 The cards are designed using the tikz library for LaTeX. 
 The design is inspired by a reddit post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/2ma7c2/two_rooms_and_a_boom_print_and_play/) and the tikz is hacked together from an amazing post on stackoverflow [here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/185830).


To Use
------

Simply download the pre-made pdfs in the `pdf/` directory

or

Customise or create a new deck of cards using the pre-made templates and compile using LaTeX (or the `compile_all` script).
