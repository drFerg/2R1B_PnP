Two Rooms and A Boom
====================


 A custom PnP version of the popular social deduction party game, Two Rooms and A Boom. The existing print and play version is pretty damn ugly and the cards lack any useful character info, so this version aims to resolve that.

 The cards are designed using the tikz library for LaTeX. 
 The design is inspired by a reddit post (here)[https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/2ma7c2/two_rooms_and_a_boom_print_and_play/] and the tikz is hacked together from an amazing post on stackoverflow [here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/185830).


To Use
------

Simply download the pre-made pdfs...

or

Customise or create a new deck of cards using the pre-made templates and compile using LaTeX.
